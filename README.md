# ü™± Rootkit Removal Tool (RRT)
A Simpe python coded tool to remove a piece of malware called a Rootkit.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è What is a Rootkit?
A Rootkit is a piece of software that is installed with usually Malware to hide it's path, now you cannot find it normally by clicking show Hidden Files on windows, instead you have to use special disinfection tools to remove a Rootkit.

A Rootkit is usually used with a prefix especially the RING 3 VARIANT which the most popular is r77 which the task name would be $77{Process_Name} or $77{Hidden_Folder} a rootkit can be also used to hide malware a recent case of this is the drama
with SeroXen Remote Access Trojan which utilised a Rootkit but then a furthermore BOOTKIT to stop antivirus and the User from finding the PowerShell Process and removing it easily.

# üëã Is this safe to Use?
Yes this tool is fully open sourced so of course it will be safe, source code is provided this version of ring3 rootkit remover is based on R77 Rootkit by bytecode77 and it is also made to Remove Onimai Remote Access Trojan.

The Idea came from the original "Onibye" which could remove Onimai this tool is just a safer option of that as it doesn't download files on opening to remove the Rootkit and it isn't coded in C#/.NET And Obfuscated so you don't know if it's safe.

The "Onibye" by Ian on Discord is most likely actually Infected it's general Ring 3 Rootkit Remover Process has a XWorm PowerShell Payload attatched to it probably meaning it's a Phantom Crypted or Scrub Crypted or Jlaive Crypted Payload.

# üì¢ Will this update?
